Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting. Built on Chrome's V8 engine, it is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it efficient and scalable. Node.js is widely used for building fast, real-time applications like chat servers and collaborative tools. With npm (Node Package Manager), developers can easily access and manage thousands of modules, simplifying the development process. Its asynchronous nature is ideal for handling multiple I/O operations, such as file or database tasks.
